=head2 Objective

I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2013 that will provide me with both interesting coding challenges and valuable work experience.

=head2 Summary

I have always had an interest in computers. Since teaching myself Java in 8th grade, Iâ€™ve enjoyed tackling and solving coding problems. I pick up new concepts quickly, and frequently research interesting things independently.

=head2 Special Accomplishments

In collaboration with Joseph Batchik (first year Computer Science Student at RIT) I created an 
Android application for viewing and posting to WebNews, a news client built on top of NNTP by 
another Computer Science House Member. The app uses APIs provided by WebNews to fetch and post 
data, and provides a hugely improved experience over using WebNews in the browser on an Android phone.

In August of 2012 the Computer Science House held a Gamejam. The rules were to create a game in 
under 24 hours. With some help from Mike Eaton (a graduate from Fairport High School), I created 
FPSCubes using XNA, a first person shooter that used a third party physics engine. There were a 
total of five submissions, and I was the only first year student to submit a game. My game was 
declared the winner.
