\section{\mysidestyle Objective}
	I'm looking for a coop in the summer of 2013 that will provide me with both interesting programming challenges and work experience.

\section{\mysidestyle Summary}
        I've always had an interest in computers. Since teaching myself Java in 8th grade, I've enjoyed tackling computing problems. I pick up new concepts quickly, and frequently research interesting things independently.
