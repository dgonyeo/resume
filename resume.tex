\section{\mysidestyle Objective}
	I'm currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2013 that will provide me with both interesting coding challenges and valuable work experience.

\section{\mysidestyle Summary}
        I've always had an interest in computers. Since teaching myself Java in 8th grade, I've enjoyed tackling and solving coding problems. I pick up new concepts quickly, and frequently research interesting things independently.

\section{\mysidestyle Special Accomplishments}
	\begin{asparablank}
		\item In collaboration with Joseph Batchik (first year Computer Science Student at RIT) I created an Android application for viewing and posting to WebNews, a news client built on top of NNTP by another Computer Science House Member. The app uses APIs provided by WebNews to fetch and post data, and provides a hugely improved experience over using WebNews in the browser on an Android phone. \rurl{http://github.com/dgonyeo/AndroidWebnews}
                \item In August of 2012 the Computer Science House held a Gamejam. The rules were to create a game in under 24 hours. With some help from Mike Eaton (a graduate from Fairport High School), I created FPSCubes using XNA, a first person shooter that used a third party physics engine. There were a total of five submissions, and I was the only first year student to submit a game. My game was declared the winner. \rurl{http://http://gamejam.csh.rit.edu/jams/2012/summer.php}
