        \employer{Hudl}{Lincoln, NE}{June 2014 - Present}{Software Engineer Intern}{http://hudl.com}

        \small
        Worked full time during the summer of 2014, and have continued to work part time during the 2014-15 school year. Worked on a project called Heimdall that received notifications via a REST API, combines similar notifications into single incidents, alerts the employee on call, and exposes a website for viewing and manipulating incidents. Integrates with Postmark, Stack Driver, SNS, Cloudwatch, and PagerDuty.

\section{\mysidestyle Projects}
    \begin{compactdesc}
        \item[Haskell CRDT] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/gatekeeper} \\
            Implemented a Commutative Replicated Data Type from scratch in Haskell. A CRDT is a distributed data set with weak consistency guarantees, that replicates its data set to all nodes. Pulls data from LDAP, and uses Google's Protocol Buffers to transfer data between nodes. Gained familiarity with Haskell, Protocol Buffers, and distributed concepts like the CAP Theorem.
        \item[ODD - One Dimensional Display] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/odd} \\
            Designed and build a custom display of RGB LEDs, controlled by a Raspberry Pi. Can be controlled over the network to add and remove animations with various parameters. Animations include holding a color, displaying a rainbow, strobing, and the game of life. Some animations analyze real time audio streams to display a music light show based on music. Gained familiarity with basic circuit board design, C, ALSA, and Fast Fourier Transforms.
        \item[Brandreth Statistics] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/brandreth2.0} \\
            Created a website for accessing 20 years of entries from guest books at a friend's cabin. Allows users to search for and read all the entries, and generates various graphs based on the data. Gained familiarity with the Go language and Postgresql.
        \item[CSH News] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/AndroidWebnews} \\
            Created an Android application that allows Computer Science House members to easily read posts from and write posts to an internal news service. Utilized an existing REST API built on top of NNTP. Gained familiarity with the Android SDK.
