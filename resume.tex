        \item[Haskell CRDT] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/gatekeeper} \\
            Implemented a Commutative Replicated Data Type, or CRDT, from scratch in Haskell. A CRDT is a distributed data set with weak consistency guarantees. Pulls data from LDAP, and uses Google's Protocol Buffers to transfer data between nodes. Gained familiarity with Haskell, Protocol Buffers, and distributed concepts like the CAP Theorem. \\
        \item[ODD - One Dimensional Display] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/odd} \\
            Designed and build a custom display of RGB LEDs, controlled by a Raspberry Pi. Can be controlled over the network to add and remove animations with various parameters. Animations include holding a color, displaying a rainbow, strobing, and the game of life. Some animations analyze real time audio streams to display a music light show based on music. Gained familiarity with basic circuit board design, C, ALSA, and Fast Fourier Transforms. \\
        \item[Brandreth Statistics] \rurl{https://github.com/dgonyeo/brandreth2.0} \\
            Created a website for accessing 20 years of entries from guest books at a friend's cabin. Gained familiarity with the Go language and PostgreSQL.
